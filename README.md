# FakeBSODoutro

Created this because I was bored and that one time I used TikTok for more than 5 minutes I saw this and the rest is in the description.

What else am I supposed to write here?
Maybe uhh
It doesn't actually crash Windows (*if this repo name didn't give it away already*).
It just makes it look like it did. (Hey that sentence was made by GitHub Copilot! Why do I even have it activated for MD?)
Who am I even talking to

Ah yes before i forget it..

## Usage
Theres 2 ways.\
Either get the [.NET 6 *Desktop* runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) (unless you already have this for some reason), download the FakeBSODoutro.exe and run it.

#### OR

Download the FakeBSODoutro-SelfContained.zip file if you don't want to download the .NET 6 Desktop Runtime (First use may take a few seconds), extract the file in it and run it.

## How it works 

A CMD prompt will be opened (if Windows Terminal is opening, run the file as admin) and then the countdown begins.
After the countdown ended a WinForms window will appear maximized with no border style which then displays the Windows 10/11 BSoD image in a PictureBox.
